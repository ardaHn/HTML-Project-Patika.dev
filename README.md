# HTML-Project-Patika.dev
A simple piece of project that was necessary to finish a certain HTML chapter in Patika.Dev Website. This project was the re-summing of everything I have learned so far. 

# What I Learned
As the process of learning goes on, it is essential to make sure that we do not forget the things that we have learned along the way. Simple projects like these allow me to hold on to everything that I am learning. Also during this project I managed to make a website that has multiple layers and pages so that's a plus.
